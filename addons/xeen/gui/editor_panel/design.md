# Elements

- Tabs: Geometry, Objects, Settings

- Toolbar (in Geometry and Objects tabs)
  - Brush 
  - Box Select
  - Fill Rectangle
  - Flood Fill (behaviour for objects?)

- BrushView (in geometry mode, shows face materials and other props)
- ObjectView (on object mode, shows kv-pairs for customisation?)

- AssetBrowser
  - Shows material previews in geometry mode
  - Shows object previews in object mode

## What is currently missing?
- Users should be able to use custom cell scenes. For convenience, they ought to be displayed in another asset browser instance.
- BrushView currently has no controls to configure additional face settings like uvscale, visibility, passability, rotation etc.
    - An icon based status bar could be added below or onto each button to show current settings.
    - Per-face settings can be changed below the brush view and applied to one or more faces via ctrl+shortcut
- Object view is still quite a ways away until I added support for them in the map.
